# Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Prediction Analysis
## Introduction
The researchers preprocessed and cleaned the BRFSS dataset. Out of 304 unique variables, they selected 19 variables related to lifestyle factors that may contribute to the risk of cardiovascular diseases. The next step is to analyze which variables have the most impact on the risk of cardiovascular diseases and then provide recommendations and solutions for patients.

My final project at MindX was completed with team. I gained valuable skills in teamwork, finding insights, storytelling, and knowledge related to health.
